"""
Tests for digest/errors.py — the @with_retries decorator.

@with_retries wraps a callable and retries it up to max_attempts times when one
of the specified exception types is raised. A linear backoff (backoff * attempt
seconds) is applied between retries.

All tests use backoff=0 to skip sleep delays and keep the suite fast.
