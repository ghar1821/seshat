## Running tests

```bash
# Install dev dependencies first (once)
uv sync --group dev

# Run all unit tests
uv run pytest

# Run integration tests (requires live services — see below)
uv run pytest -m integration

# Run unit tests only, explicitly skipping integration tests
uv run pytest -m "not integration"

# Run a single test file
uv run pytest tests/test_store.py

# Run a single test by name
uv run pytest tests/test_store.py::test_add_paper_is_idempotent

## Test infrastructure

### Dedicated ChromaDB store

KB tests use a real ChromaDB instance persisted at `tests/.chroma/` (gitignored,
never committed). Each test creates a collection named `test_<uuid8>` inside that
directory and deletes it at teardown. This means:

- Tests are fully isolated from each other (separate collections)
- The store directory itself persists between runs (no re-initialisation overhead)
- The embedding model is not reloaded for every test

### Real HuggingFace embeddings

The actual `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedding model is used in `test_store.py` rather
than a mock or a deterministic stub. The model downloads once to
`~/.cache/huggingface/` (~90 MB) on the very first run and is reused from local
cache on all subsequent runs.

**Why not mock the embeddings?** A fake embedding function that returns zeroes or
random vectors would hide real failure modes — ChromaDB filter behaviour, the
LangChain wrapper's batching logic, and search result ranking all depend on actual
vector values. The one-off download cost is worth the fidelity. This preference
(a modest one-off setup cost over a mock that obscures real behaviour) is the
general policy for this project; apply the same reasoning to other test decisions.

## Integration tests

Tests marked `@pytest.mark.integration` require live external services:

| Test | Requirement |
|---|---|
| `test_anthropic_client_initialises` | API key in `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var or `~/.seshat/config.toml [auth]` |
| `test_anthropic_models_list_confirms_auth` | API key + internet access |
| `test_ollama_server_is_reachable` | Running Ollama server at `http://localhost:11434` |

Integration tests make no token-consuming LLM calls — they only validate
connectivity and credentials.

## What is tested

| File | Module | Behaviours covered |
|---|---|---|
| `test_config.py` | `digest/config.py` | Defaults when no TOML; TOML overrides defaults; env vars override TOML; `~` in paths expanded; `[auth] api_key` loaded |
| `test_errors.py` | `digest/errors.py` | `@with_retries`: success on first try; retry on matching exception; raise after max attempts; no retry on non-matching exception |
| `test_arxiv_convert.py` | `digest/arxiv/convert.py` | `parse_arxiv_url()`: `/abs/` URL; `/pdf/` URL; version suffix preserved; non-arXiv URL returns None |
| `test_store.py` | `digest/kb/store.py` | `add_texts` count; `add_paper` idempotency; visibility filter; privacy check (cloud and local); `delete_by_metadata`; `list_papers` deduplication and chunk count; `update_file_path` metadata and URI; `update_file_path` unknown source; `refresh_vault` add / update / delete / PDF notes preserved |
| `test_llm.py` *(integration)* | `digest/llm.py` | Anthropic client initialisation; models list API call; Ollama server reachability |

## What is not tested

| Module | Reason |
|---|---|
| `digest/llm.py` (beyond connectivity) | Wraps external APIs; meaningful correctness tests would require mocking the full HTTP layer, which is not preferred |
| `digest/arxiv/fetch.py` | Same — live arXiv API |
| `digest/pipeline/` | Depends on LLM responses; correctness is validated by running the pipeline |
| `vault_chat/chat.py` | The agentic loop is integration-level; all KB behaviour it relies on is covered by `test_store.py` |
| `webapp/` | The web UI is integration-level (requires a live browser, server, and LLM); the FastAPI routes and SSE stream are thin wrappers over `vault_chat/chat.py` which is already covered |
